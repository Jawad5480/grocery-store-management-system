# ðŸ›’ Grocery Store Management System

This is a full-stack **Grocery Store Management System** developed as part of my Software Construction & Development lab. It manages products, orders, units of measure, and user login with a MySQL database backend and Python Flask APIs.

**Features:**

- Add, view, and delete products
- Manage Units of Measure (UOM)
- Place and view orders with order details
- User login authentication
- Frontend built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery
- Backend built with Python Flask API
- MySQL database integration

**Project Structure:**

/python_projects_grocery_webapp  
â”‚  
â”œâ”€â”€ server.py â€“ Flask server with all APIs (products, orders, login)  
â”œâ”€â”€ sql_connection.py â€“ MySQL connection setup file  
â”œâ”€â”€ products_dao.py â€“ Product database operations (CRUD)  
â”œâ”€â”€ uom_dao.py â€“ UOM database operations  
â”œâ”€â”€ orders_dao.py â€“ Orders database operations  
â”‚  
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/  
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html â€“ Main dashboard page  
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login.html â€“ User login page  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ static/  
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ common.js â€“ API calling functions and common JS  
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ order.js â€“ Order management JS  
â”‚  
â””â”€â”€ database.sql â€“ MySQL tables and sample data (products, uom, orders, users)

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Jawad5480/grocery-store-management-system.git  
cd grocery-store-management

2. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python and MySQL are installed.

pip install flask flask-cors mysql-connector-python

3. Setup MySQL Database

- Open MySQL Workbench  
- Create a new schema (e.g. grocerydb)  
- Run `database.sql` to create tables (`products`, `orders`, `order_details`, `uom`, `users`) and insert sample data  
- Update your `sql_connection.py` file with your MySQL username, password, and database name

4. Run the Flask Server

python server.py

The server will run at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

5. Access the Frontend

Open `frontend/templates/login.html` in your browser to login, then navigate to `index.html` to manage products and orders.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Developed RESTful APIs using Flask for product, order, and user management  
- Integrated frontend with backend APIs using jQuery AJAX  
- Managed MySQL CRUD operations via Python DAO pattern  
- Understood full-stack development workflow and database connectivity
